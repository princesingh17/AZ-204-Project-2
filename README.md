# Azure Cosmos DB with .NET â€“ AZ-204 Project 2

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates how to provision and configure an **Azure Cosmos DB** database using the Azure Portal and interact with it using a **.NET console application**. This serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Skill-Up Online to explore managed database services on Azure.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Azure Portal
- Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)
- Azure Resource Manager
- .NET Console Application (C#)
- Azure SDK for .NET

## ðŸ”„ Project Tasks

1. Created a new **Resource Group** named `AZ204-Project2-RG` in the **East US** region.
